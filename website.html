        A foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal,
         Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops,
          his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice.
           It was once declared "one of the most recognisable voices in rock".
            He was also noted for his unique posture when singing,
             which was once described as "looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face".
              He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an "overpowered,
               distorted rhythmic rumble". A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing,
                often playing power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.
